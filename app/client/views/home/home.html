            Resort Mate is a booking management and invoicing app for pensions and hotels. We started the development of
            Resort Mate because we found that existing management software for hotels are far too complex with functions
            that are not needed to manage pensions or small-scale hotels. Resort Mate has a simple role management and
            access management and if permissions are granted data can be accessed from within any browser. Currently,
            only Google Chrome for desktop version 45 or higher is supported. Other browser might work but can lead to
            unexpected application behavior. We have support of other major browsers and a version for mobile devices on
            our roadmap, which will be available on release of Resort Mate.

            In the meantime you can test an alpha release of Resort Mate. We've created test accounts, which you can find
            further down this page.

            We know that an easy-to-use and easy-to-learn user interface is mandatory for the success of Resort Mate and
            user experience and a fun-to-use application can bring added value. This is why we are currently in beta-testing
            with a real client and plan to go live once we are satisfied with the user experience.

            We've created three user accounts to play with and test Resort Mate. Each user account is associated to
            with different role. The manager role has access to customer data, can manage rooms and order items, add
            or change bookings, and create offers and invoices. The curator role can access to customer data and add
            or change bookings. The accountant role can access customer data and add or change offers and invoices.
